# Likelihood-based-inference
 This repository contains several Julia codes that are associated with "Likelihood-based inference, identifiability and prediction using count data from lattice-based random walk models" by Yihan Liu, David J. Warne and Matthew J Simpson.

# Experiment
 This file contain two sub-files: Single_population and Two_subpopulation.
# Single_population from Experiment
 Data.jl is responsible for genrate all data need to create Figure 2(a) and Figure2a.jl is reponsible to create create Figure 2(a) using the data.
# Two_subpopulation from Experiment
 Data.jl is responsible for genrate all data need to create Figure 2(b) and Figure2b.jl is reponsible to create create Figure 2(b) using the data.
# Case1
 This file contian three sub-files: Data, Additive_Gaussian and Multinomial
# Data from Case1
 Data.jl is responsible for genrate all data need to create Figure 3(a)-(d) and Figure3a-d.jl is reponsible to create create Figure 3(a)-(d) using the data.
# Additive_Gaussian from Case1
 additve_Gaussian.jl is use to generate the result for additive Gaussian measurement error model for Case 1
# Multinomial from Case1
 Multinomial.jl is use to generate the result for multinomial measurement error model for Case 1
# Case2
 This file contian three sub-files: Data, Additive_Gaussian and Multinomial
# Data from Case2
 Data.jl is responsible for genrate all data need to create Figure 3(e)-(j) and Figure3e-j.jl is reponsible to create create Figure 3(e)-(j) using the data.
# Additive_Gaussian from Case2
 additve_Gaussian.jl is use to generate the result for additive Gaussian measurement error model for Case 2
# Multinomial from Case2
 Multinomial.jl is use to generate the result for multinomial measurement error model for Case 2
