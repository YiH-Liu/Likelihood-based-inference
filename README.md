# Likelihood-based-inference
 This repository contains several Julia codes that are associated with "Likelihood-based inference, identifiability and prediction using count data from lattice-based random walk models" by Yihan Liu, David J. Warne and Matthew J Simpson.

# Experiment
 This file contain two sub-files: Single_population and Two_subpopulation.
 In Single_population file Data.jl is responsible for genrate all data need to create Figure 2(a) and Figure2a.jl is reponsible to create create Figure 2(a) using the data.
 In Two_subpopulation file Data.jl is responsible for genrate all data need to create Figure 2(b) and Figure2b.jl is reponsible to create create Figure 2(b) using the data.
